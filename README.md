# Order-Food-Application
Hello all,<br>
  This time I have made an order food application with Firebase Database and Java programming language for backend and for frontend, I have used XML.<br>
  There are two panels in the application: Admin and User panel.
  <br><br><br>
1.Admin Panel:<br>
  -It will have all the order details of the users. <br>
  -If the order is delivered, the admin will have a "To be Delivered" button with every order. When the admin clicks on that button, that order will be removed from the app for some temporary time. <br>
  -When the admin will login again that order will be displayed again but with a changed colour of the delivered button and changed text of the button as "Delivered", so the admin can identify orders which are already delivered and the orders which are still pending to be delivered.<br>
  -The admin panel will be refreshed every minute.<br>
<br><br>
2.User Panel:<br>
  -Users will have 2 options: Register and Login option<br>
  -When the user fills in the details and clicks on the register button, he/she will get an email for authentication. After authenticating, users will be able to login.<br>
  -After successful login, users can order items and give the date of the delivery and time by selecting a timeslot from the dropdown menu.<br>
  -After confirming their order they will get a notification that their order is placed and will get all the details of their order in the app.<br>
